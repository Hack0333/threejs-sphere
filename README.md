# Sphere Animation with Three.js

## üìñ Overview

This project demonstrates a 3D animated sphere using **Three.js** for rendering, **GSAP** for smooth animations, and **Vite** as the development server. The sphere responds to mouse interactions, changing its color dynamically based on cursor position.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library for creating 3D graphics in the browser.
- **GSAP**: A powerful JavaScript library for building high-performance animations.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **Vite**: A modern frontend build tool for fast development.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have **Node.js** installed. You can check if Node is installed by running:

```
node -v
```

## Installation

### 1. Clone git repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/Hack0333/threejs-sphere.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies:
